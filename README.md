## 🛠 Usage & Settings

#### Setting Up
- Open the command palette and run `Create required tag and props`.

#### Adding Map and Markers
2. Tag your block with the tag `#Location`. This creates two properties: `map-url` and `marker-color`.
3. Add the Google Maps link to your `map-url` property.
4. Add a colour to the `marker-color` property.
5. Go to any block on the same page and insert the map container using the slash command `Add map container`
6. Continue to add in other blocks tagged with `#Location` and the map will pick up these locations and create them as markers
